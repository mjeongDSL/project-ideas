# Free project 1
### Shared Spaces

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

This project serves a group of people who share a set of spaces and need to use the spaces at various times. Examples include kitchenes, lab spaces, and study room. This language would ideally be good for any user to reserve a space or designate the space as 'occupied'.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

Shared spaces are often managed by some form of scheduler but the interfaces we use for them are nonintuitive and rather poor.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_



### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
